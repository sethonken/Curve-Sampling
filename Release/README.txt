Sampling

This program can create curve samples based on line inputs from the user. To use the program,
create a line by defining two points (by mouse click). After all lines have been made, the next click 
will define a point on a curve that passes through the intersections from line 1 and the intersections
from line 2.

Attached to mouse right:

-reset
	-This will clear all points.

-change density [current value]
	-Gives the ability to increase or decrease density values.

-change to (3/4) lines
	-Toggles line mode between either 3 or 4 lines.

-allow moving extra point
	-Allows the extra point to be moved and the curve will follow.

-allow moving line points
	-Allows line points to be moved and the curve will follow.
